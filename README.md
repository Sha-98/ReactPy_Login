# ReactPy_Login

Need to create an interactive login page which takes the introductory details of user as input through a form and stores that data in mongodb atlas database when user clicks on submit and shows a message to user that you are successfully registered. 

All this need to be done using ReactPy library of python, with backend using one of the following: FastAPI, Flask, Scarlet. Current code uses FastAPI

Current version of code has a bug, the form is getting reloaded when we click on submit button, plus input data is not getting stored, or may be i do not know where is it getting stored.

Another need for this project is connection between app and mongodb atlas database.
